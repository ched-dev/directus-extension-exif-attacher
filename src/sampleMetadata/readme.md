# Sample Metadata

These files are json snapshots of the data returned by Directus when you do:

```
# GET /files/ASSET_ID
GET /files/26ddcdb3-43f0-4eb8-9aeb-aadb47b174a3
```

We use the `data.metadata` of the file to test our EXIF extraction. If you have a use case you would like covered, feel free to submit a PR with your cameras EXIF data. Most EXIF is covered by our standard EXIF data extraction.
